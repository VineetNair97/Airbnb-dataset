## How the Airbnbâ€™s dataset from Newyork city can help us to find the best and the economical host? ##

Airbnb, Inc. is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
So, the intended value of this project is to get insights about the type of rooms and hosts available in NYC through visualization of various plots.

### Data Source & Preprocessing: ###
Here, I have used the data from Kaggle.com. The various features of this dataset includes name, host_id, host_name, neighborhood_group, neighborhood, room_type, price, minimum_nights, No_of_reviews, Last_review, reviews_per_month, and availability. This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.

As a part of data cleansing I implemented the following steps:
1.	In the column minimum-nights, all the values > 365 were removed
2.	In the column no-of-reviews, the reviews >500 were removed.
3.	And price>1800 and price<1 were also removed.

### Exploratory Data analysis ###

Types of neighborhood groups and their price: As it is known that Manhattan is the popular tourist spot in New York so it is quite obvious that price in that area would be high as compared to other places because the standard ofliving  is too high and the popular tourist spot and possibly people from other parts comes in here because of job opportunity finds an easy shelter through airbnb's service.

The various room types available are either entire room or private room or the shared ones. from the pie-chart it can be seen that almost 50% of all the available room types is of entire room and just 2.5% of them contains the shared ones.
